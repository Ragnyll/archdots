# Keshi Pearl Conky

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My conky confs and scripts.
 Heavily based off of Ninquitassar's [Black Pearl Conky](https://www.deviantart.com/ninquitassar/art/Black-Pearl-Conky-281468275) (ergo the near name), but I hate their code and that style of conky config is very out of date, so this is my own implementation and preferences.
 I also would prefer not to mix elements provided in the rc file with the lua, so as much of the implementation of this as possible is Lua, so basically all elements except for the pane that it is drawn on.
 Any 1920x1080 monitor can steal the conkyrc files without having to modify anything, the only changes are to the config objects with the gaugue files.
